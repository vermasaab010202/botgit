## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK 26+ (Android 8.0)
- Kotlin 1.9+
- Gradle 8.0+

### Building the App
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `android` folder in Android Studio
3. Sync the project with Gradle files
4. Build and run on device/emulator

### Configuration
The app uses the following permissions:
- `USE_BIOMETRIC` - For biometric authentication
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - For expense reminders
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - For recurring transaction processing

## Data Model

### Core Entities
- **Transaction**: Financial transactions with amount, category, date, and recurring properties
- **Category**: Expense/income categories with emoji, color, and ordering
- **Budget**: Category-specific budgets with time periods and sustainability flags
- **MainBudget**: Overall spending budgets

### Relationships
- Transactions belong to Categories (many-to-one)
- Budgets are linked to Categories (many-to-one)
- All entities support full CRUD operations

## Key Features Implementation

### Recurring Transactions
- Background WorkManager processes recurring transactions
- Supports daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly frequencies
- Prevents duplicate creation with date-based checks

### Biometric Security
- Optional app lock with fingerprint/face authentication
- Graceful fallback for devices without biometric hardware
- Secure preference storage

### Data Export/Import
- JSON format for complete data backup/restore
- CSV export for transaction analysis
- File picker integration for easy data management

### Home Screen Widget
- Displays current balance and recent activity
- Updates automatically with transaction changes
- Configurable refresh intervals

## Development Status

âœ… **Completed Components:**
- Complete data layer with Room database
- All UI screens and components
